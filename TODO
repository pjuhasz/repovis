# TODO:
# - documentation
# -- nice animgif for peasant blinding
# + track extent of graph (done in extent.pl)
# + outline of file blobs in blame mode (done in extent.pl)
# -- directories?
# - sort by path (File::Spec etc.)
# - hg stat shouldn't return unchanged, reuse old files info
# + write binary matrices instead of one long line of data per source line
# -- png directly?
# + support for different curves as a startup option
# + revision, exclude, include as options
# - modes:
# ++ analyze that produces blame and file mode data for all revisions, cache it in .repovis
# +++ keep some of the file, user etc. data between revisions for performance and consistency
# +++ use hg stat --change REV to get changed/added/deleted files, and hg blame --rev REV only those files, keep track of the rest
# +++ but this mode is broken because of branches
# ++++ check if there are >1 children or the one child is not the next one, in these cases save $self->{files} in
#      $self->{revs}{saved_files}, and mark this rev as need_to_save_files, and mark the child revs as need_to_use_saved_files
#      the marked child revs need to copy the saved files struct from the cache to the current files struct
# ---- merges, renamed/moved files?
# ---- flash label red if moved/renamed/copied
# ---- different commit colors for merges?
# ++ interactive mode that just launches the gnuplot with the cached data (default when ran without parameters)
# --- more info in title/on graph: rev/node, desc, author, parent/children nodes (indicate if merge/fork), branch, legend
# --- better, fine-grained control to walk graph, by default jump to first parent/children
# -- non-interactive parametric mode to generate image for just one rev
# -- animate to create animations from images
# + commit timeline with the same user/hue, commit/saturation colors as blame mode
# -- branch graph?
# - show deletions by red lines between pixels?
# + file mode colors should vary value, not just saturation
# ++ value could show line position (lighter towards end of file)?
# +++ this would need a new key in the pt struct, and to move the hsv2rgb call back to matrix print (with some perf loss)
# ---- option to use the old-style flat coloring?
# + blame colors: does max saturation mean currently viewed rev, or max rev in repo?
#   + current: then we should change the colors on the timeline too, which is tricky and confusing
# + sort files by date?
# + for modified files in relative mode, parse diff (just the @@ lines are enough) instead of full blame
# + cmdserver for hg (should be as fast or faster than a single blame -unf on all files)
# ++ or just simply return an aref of lines
# + refactor all those max_x etc. calculations into an extent class or something
# + refactor coords struct to use array instead of hash? worse readability, but less memory and a bit faster
# - git, svn? support
# ? js+html output? (yuck)
